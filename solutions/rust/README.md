# Usage - Rust
To use the Rust solutions in this repository, follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the directory corresponding to the year and day of the challenge you want to execute. For example, if you want to run the solution for Day 1 of Year 2022, navigate to the 2022/day-01 directory.

2. Make sure you have Rust installed on your system. If Rust is not installed, you can download and install it from the official Rust website.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and execute the following command to build and run the solution using Cargo:
```bash
cargo run
```
This command will compile and execute the solution code for the challenge. If the code requires any input, you can provide it through the terminal or by modifying the code directly.

The Cargo build system will handle the compilation process and manage dependencies automatically.

4. The output of the solution will be displayed in the terminal or command prompt.

Note: Some solutions may have additional requirements or instructions mentioned in the specific day's README.md file. Make sure to check the README.md file in the respective day's directory for any additional information.

Happy coding with Rust!
